A few months ago, I read [Writing for Busy Readers](https://writingforbusyreaders.com/) and absolutely loved it. I would 100% recommend it to anyone with a job that involves even a teeny bit of writing.

The whole book is worth reading, but I wanted to post a link to their 1-pager [cheat sheet](https://writingforbusyreaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Writing-for-Busy-Readers-Checklist.pdf) here where I can more easily find it.
