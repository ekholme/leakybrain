So, I typically write SQL queries directly in R as strings because I often want to pass function arguments to them, e.g.

```r
make_query <- function(year) {
    ret <- paste("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE year = " year)
    return(ret)
} 
```

But sometimes I find it easier to just write a canned query in a `.sql` file, often when I'm using that query in another non-R program, or when I need one "true" query that gets passed around to various other applications. If we need to read this into R, we just need a combination of `paste()` and `readLines()`.

Imagine we have the following query in `my_query.sql`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
```

And then we want to read that query in and execute it in R. We would just do:

```r
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(
    #specify arguments here to connect to your DB
)

qry <- paste(readLines("my_query.sql"), collapse = "\n")

res <- dbGetQuery(con, qry)
```

And that will do it!
