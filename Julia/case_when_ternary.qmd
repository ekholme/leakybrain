As far as I can tell, DataFrames.jl doesn't have a built-in case-when function, but I found [this post](https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/12/18/casewhen.html) from Bogumil Kaminski showing how to implement case-when via the ternary operator.

Here's the basic idea, but it's also extensible to include multiple variables or to include missing values.

```{julia}
using DataFrames

X = DataFrame(a = 1:10)
```

```{julia}
transform!(
    X,
    :a => ByRow(a -> a % 2 == 0 ? "foo" : a % 3 == 0 ? "bar" : "baz") => :y
);

first(X, 5)
```
